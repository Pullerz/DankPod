An iPod classic emulator written in Swift - made for fun, work in progress!

Project is NOT finished:
 - Photos section not implemented
 - Videos section not implemented
 - Extras section not implemented
 - Settings section not implemented
 - Half way through implementing a queuing system using force touch but not complete

I didn't have access to a physical iPod Classic to make this so I've done my best to recreate the UI based off screenshots, apologies if I didn't get everything 100% correct.
  
If you do anything cool with this project I'd love to see it!
